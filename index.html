  <h3>News</h3>
  <p>
    I am currently working on my <strong>B. Tech Project</strong>, which is to <strong>Parallelize a clustering algorithm</strong> which is runtime agnostic in C, I am happy to say that we're getting positive results, both in terms of energy and
    speedup.

          Clustering is a Standard NP-Hard Problem, which plays an important role
          to understand communities in an network, A moderate size graph can take
          upto many days if not week, The goal of this project is to Parallelize
          a clustering algorithm & at the same time make it energy efficient.

          Plant vs Zombies is a very popular game, available at Google play. The
          goal of this project is to recreate this standard game with the option
          to save player profiles and game progress using Concept's of OOP in Java.

          As New Technologies are arising every day, It's getting hard to keep track
          of which tool to use and which ones are outdated, Keeping track of different
          kind of extensions for different files, We introduce SRA Data alignment,
          The user has to install Android Application on their smartphones and store
          executable script on there, The app will take input of ssh address and GEOID,
          The app will automatically download SRA data on your server along with genome
          and start its alignment.

    Position/Responsibility
  </h3>
  <p>
    We organized a new event in our college technical fest named "
    <a href="images/biowhiz_2.jpg" target="_blank">BioWhiz</a>", The goal
    was to promote our Computational Biology Branch among different colleges and school
    students, There were three rounds, First round was a MCQ quiz of very basic questions
    of biology, Second round was guessing the Science Fiction movie. In last round we asked
    Questions which are mix of Computation and biology. We had Blast & BioWhiz was a great
    success with reach of 10K+ on facebook. The top 3
    <a href="images/biowhiz_winners.jpg" target="_blank">winners</a>
    were awarded money 4K, 3K & 2K,
    First Position holder was Mohammad Basil Asad.
