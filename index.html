      I am currently working on my <strong>B. Tech Project</strong>, which is to <strong>Parallelize a clustering algorithm</strong> which is runtime agnostic in C, I am happy to say that we're getting positive results, both in terms of energy and
      speedup.

            Clustering is a Standard NP-Hard Problem, which plays an important role
            to understand communities in an network, A moderate size graph can take
            upto many days if not week, The goal of this project is to Parallelize
            a clustering algorithm & at the same time make it energy efficient.

            Plant vs Zombies is a very popular game, available at Google play. The
            goal of this project is to recreate this standard game with the option
            to save player profiles and game progress using Concept's of OOP in Java.

            As New Technologies are arising every day, It's getting hard to keep track
            of which tool to use and which ones are outdated, Keeping track of different
            kind of extensions for different files, We introduce SRA Data alignment,
            The user has to install Android Application on their smartphones and store
            executable script on there, The app will take input of ssh address and GEOID,
            The app will automatically download SRA data on your server along with genome
            and start its alignment.

      We organized a new event in our college technical fest named <a href="images/biowhiz_2.jpg" target="_blank">BioWhiz</a>, The goal was to
      promote our Computational Biology Branch among different colleges and school
      students, There were three rounds, First round was an MCQ quiz of very basic
      questions of biology, Second round was guessing the Science Fiction movie. In
      the last round, we asked Questions which are a mix of Computation and biology.
      We had Blast & BioWhiz was a great success with the reach of 10K+ on Facebook.
      The top 3
      <a href="images/biowhiz_winners.jpg" target="_blank">winners</a>
      were awarded money 4K, 3K & 2K, First Position holder was Mohammad Basil Asad.

      We did community work in an NGO organization <a href="http://www.manzil.in/" target="_blank">Manzil</a>, Manzil Is A Non-profit, Youth-Led Learning Center. Manzil is Providing A Supportive Community And Resources For Students To Empower
      Themselves. At manzil we taught python 3 to students and teachers, helped them out & provided them as much technical support we could, It was also a rare opportunity for us, to see how the organization works & Learn how they support each other,
      All of the members of the team were really cool, kind and passionate about what they do. It was a really good and fun experience for us.
