      We did community work in an NGO organization <a href="http://www.manzil.in/" target="_blank">Manzil</a>, Manzil Is A Non-profit, Youth-Led Learning Center. Manzil is Providing A Supportive Community And Resources For Students To Empower
      Themselves. At manzil we taught python 3 to students and teachers, helped them out & provided them as much technical support we could, It was also a rare opportunity for us, to see how the organization works & Learn how they support each other,
      All of the members of the team were really cool, kind and passionate about what they do. It was a really good and fun experience for us.
